This project won't work as planned because I have currently removed the API key.
The api I used for this is subscription based and exceeding the daily limit usage would cost my pocket.

</br>
1/ In future, I'm planning to either get a non subcription based api.
</br>
2/ Or perhaps make it as to you could generate your own api key.
</br>
3/ Or lastly make my own bactraking sudoku solver and use it's api to complete this project.
