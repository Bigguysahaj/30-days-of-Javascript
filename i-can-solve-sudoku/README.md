This project won't work as planned because I took out the API key.
The api I used for this is subscription based and exceeding the daily limit usage would cost my pocket.

In future, I'm planning to either get a non subcription based api.
Or perhaps make it as to you could generate your own api key.
Or lastly make my own bactraking sudoku solver and use it's api to complete this project.
